# Git Commit Message Skill

**Purpose**: Provide guidance for writing clear, descriptive commit messages that explain WHAT the code does and WHY.

## PROJECT.md Commit Format (If Configured)

**Before writing a commit message, check if PROJECT.md specifies commit format rules.**

```bash
# Check for configured commit format in PROJECT.md
COMMIT_FORMAT=$(grep -A10 "### Commit Format" .claude/cat/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null)

if [[ -n "$COMMIT_FORMAT" ]]; then
  echo "Using commit format from PROJECT.md:"
  echo "$COMMIT_FORMAT"
  echo ""
  echo "Apply any MUST rules from PROJECT.md to the commit message."
fi
```

**When PROJECT.md has commit format rules:**
- MUST rules are mandatory - follow them exactly
- SHOULD rules are recommended - follow unless you have a good reason not to
- MAY rules are optional - use your judgment

**If no PROJECT.md configuration exists:** Use the default rules below.

## Core Principles

### 1. Describe WHAT the Code Does, Not the Process

```
# WRONG - Describes the process
Squashed commits
Combined multiple commits
Merged feature branch

# CORRECT - Describes what the code does
Add user authentication with JWT tokens
Fix memory leak in connection pool
Refactor parser to use visitor pattern
```

### 2. Use Imperative Mood (Command Form)

```
# WRONG
Added authentication
Authentication was added

# CORRECT
Add user authentication
Fix authentication timeout bug
```

### 3. Subject Line Formula

```
<Verb> <what> [<where/context>]

Examples:
Add   rate limiting      to API endpoints
Fix   memory leak        in connection pool
Refactor  parser         to use visitor pattern
```

**Rules**:
- Max 72 characters (50 ideal)
- Imperative mood (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor)
- No period at end
- Capitalize first word

### 4. Describe Changes Conceptually

The commit diff already shows which files were changed. Describe WHAT changed conceptually, not WHERE.

```
# WRONG - Subject line lists files
Update Parser.java and Lexer.java for comment handling

# WRONG - Body has "Files updated" section
config: update display standards

Files updated:
- commands/status.md
- skills/collect-results/SKILL.md
- concepts/display-standards.md

# CORRECT - Describes what changed
Fix comment handling in member declarations

# CORRECT - Body describes changes, not files
config: update display standards

Standardize fork display format and checkpoint messaging.
```

## Structure for Complex Changes

```
Subject line: Brief summary (50-72 chars, imperative mood)

Body paragraph: Explain the overall change and why it's needed.

Changes:
- First major change
- Second major change
- Third major change

Task ID: v{major}.{minor}-{task-name}
```

## Task ID Footer (MANDATORY for CAT tasks)

**Every commit for a CAT task MUST include the Task ID in the last line.** A task may span multiple
commits (across sessions or addressing distinct aspects). Each commit MUST include the same Task ID:

```
feature: add yield statement parsing support

Add YIELD_STATEMENT node type and parseYieldStatement() method
for JDK 14+ switch expressions.

- Added YIELD_STATEMENT to NodeType enum
- Created parseYieldStatement() following parseThrowStatement() pattern
- Updated ContextDetector exhaustive switch

Task ID: v3.0-add-yield-statement-support
```

**Format**: `Task ID: v{major}.{minor}-{task-name}`

**Why**: Enables reliable commit identification without storing commit hashes in documentation.
Find all commits for a task: `git log --grep="Task ID: v3.0-add-yield-statement-support"` (may
return multiple commits if the task was implemented across multiple commits)

## For Squashed Commits

**Review commits being squashed**:
```bash
git log --oneline base..HEAD
```

**Synthesize into unified message with Task ID:**

```
# WRONG - Concatenated messages, no Task ID
feature(auth): add login form
feature(auth): add validation
feature(auth): add error handling
bugfix(auth): fix typo

# CORRECT - Unified message with Task ID footer
feature: add login form with validation and error handling

- Email/password form with client-side validation
- Server-side validation with descriptive error messages
- Loading states and error display

Task ID: v1.1-implement-user-auth
```

## Commit Types (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** When working in a CAT-managed project, use ONLY these types:

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feature` | New functionality, endpoint, component | `feature: add user registration` |
| `bugfix` | Bug fix, error correction | `bugfix: correct email validation` |
| `test` | Test-only changes | `test: add failing test for hashing` |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup, no behavior change | `refactor: extract validation helper` |
| `performance` | Performance improvement | `performance: add database index` |
| `docs` | User-facing docs (README, API docs) | `docs: add API documentation` |
| `style` | Formatting, linting fixes | `style: format auth module` |
| `config` | Config, tooling, deps, Claude-facing docs | `config: add bcrypt dependency` |
| `planning` | Planning system updates | `planning: add task 5 summary` |

**NOT VALID:** `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf` - use full names instead

**Format:** `{type}: {description}`

### Commit Type Separation (MANDATORY)

**Keep one commit type per commit.** Each commit should have ONE type.

```
# WRONG - Mixed types in one commit
bugfix: fix parser bug and update documentation

Changes:
- Fix comment parsing in member declarations
- Update requirements-api.md with correct method names

# CORRECT - Separate commits by type
bugfix: fix parser bug for comments in member declarations

Task ID: v0.5-fix-comment-in-member-declaration

---

config: correct method names in requirements-api.md

Updated isReferenceEqualTo documentation.
```

**Why**: Git history becomes searchable by type. `git log --grep="^config:"` finds all config
changes. Mixed commits break this traceability.

**Rule**: If changes span multiple types, create multiple commits.

## Good Verbs for Description

| Verb | Use For |
|------|---------|
| **add** | New feature, file, function |
| **fix** | Bug fix or correction |
| **update** | Modify existing feature (non-breaking) |
| **remove** | Delete feature, file, or code |
| **refactor** | Restructure without changing behavior |
| **improve** | Enhance existing feature |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```
# Meaningless
WIP
Fix stuff
Updates
.

# Overly Generic
Update code
Fix bugs
Refactor

# Just the Process
Squashed commits
Merged feature branch
Combined work

# Too Technical
Change variable name from x to userCount
Move function from line 45 to line 67

# Listing Modified Files (the diff already shows this)
Update Parser.java, Lexer.java, and TokenType.java

Files updated:
- commands/status.md
- skills/collect-results/SKILL.md
```

## Checklist Before Committing

- [ ] **In correct worktree** (M101): `pwd` shows task worktree, NOT `/workspace`
- [ ] Subject line is imperative mood ("Add", not "Added")
- [ ] Subject line is specific (not "Update files")
- [ ] Subject line is under 72 characters
- [ ] Body explains WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [ ] No file names listed (the diff already shows which files changed)
- [ ] For squashed commits: synthesized meaningful summary
- [ ] **Task ID footer included** (for CAT tasks): `Task ID: vX.Y-task-name`
- [ ] Message would make sense in git history 6 months from now

## Worktree Verification (M101)

**Before committing in a CAT task, verify you're in the task worktree:**

```bash
# Quick verification
pwd  # Should show /workspace/.worktrees/<task-name>, NOT /workspace
git branch --show-current  # Should show task branch, NOT main
```

**If in wrong worktree:** Stop and navigate to the correct one before committing.

## Quick Test

Ask yourself: "If I read this in git log in 6 months, would I understand what this commit does and why?"

If no, revise the message.
