# Temporal Diversity & Complete Pipeline

## Temporal Diversity for Photo Selection

**Problem:** Without diversity constraints, all photos might come from single event (e.g., all from last vacation).

**Goal:** Ensure temporal spread across photo collection.

### Method 1: Temporal Binning

```python
def select_photos_with_temporal_diversity(photos, target_count, bin_size_days=7):
    """
    Select photos with temporal diversity.

    Ensures photos span entire collection timeframe.

    Args:
        photos: List of PhotoPoint objects
        target_count: Number of photos to select
        bin_size_days: Size of temporal bins (e.g., 7 = one photo per week)

    Returns:
        Selected photos with temporal spread
    """
    # Sort by timestamp
    photos = sorted(photos, key=lambda p: p.timestamp)

    # Find time range
    min_time = photos[0].timestamp
    max_time = photos[-1].timestamp
    total_days = (max_time - min_time).days

    # Create temporal bins
    num_bins = max(1, total_days // bin_size_days)
    bins = [[] for _ in range(num_bins)]

    for photo in photos:
        days_since_start = (photo.timestamp - min_time).days
        bin_idx = min(days_since_start // bin_size_days, num_bins - 1)
        bins[bin_idx].append(photo)

    # Select best photo from each bin
    selected = []
    photos_per_bin = max(1, target_count // num_bins)

    for bin_photos in bins:
        if not bin_photos:
            continue

        # Sort by quality
        bin_photos.sort(key=lambda p: p.aesthetic_score, reverse=True)
        selected.extend(bin_photos[:photos_per_bin])

    # If under target, add more from best bins
    if len(selected) < target_count:
        remaining = target_count - len(selected)
        all_remaining = [p for bin in bins for p in bin if p not in selected]
        all_remaining.sort(key=lambda p: p.aesthetic_score, reverse=True)
        selected.extend(all_remaining[:remaining])

    return selected[:target_count]
```

### Method 2: Temporal MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)

```python
def select_photos_temporal_mmr(photos, target_count, lambda_temporal=0.5):
    """
    Select photos using MMR with temporal diversity.

    Args:
        photos: List of PhotoPoint objects
        target_count: Number to select
        lambda_temporal: Diversity parameter (0.5 = balanced)

    Returns:
        Selected photos
    """
    selected = []

    # Select first photo: highest quality
    best_photo = max(photos, key=lambda p: p.aesthetic_score)
    selected.append(best_photo)
    remaining = [p for p in photos if p != best_photo]

    # Select remaining using MMR
    for _ in range(target_count - 1):
        best_score = -float('inf')
        best_photo = None

        for photo in remaining:
            # Quality score
            quality = photo.aesthetic_score

            # Temporal diversity: min distance to selected photos
            min_time_diff = min(
                abs((photo.timestamp - s.timestamp).total_seconds())
                for s in selected
            )

            # Normalize time diff (closer in time = higher penalty)
            temporal_diversity = 1 - np.exp(-min_time_diff / (7 * 24 * 3600))

            # MMR score
            mmr_score = lambda_temporal * quality + (1 - lambda_temporal) * temporal_diversity

            if mmr_score > best_score:
                best_score = mmr_score
                best_photo = photo

        if best_photo:
            selected.append(best_photo)
            remaining.remove(best_photo)

    return selected
```

### Method 3: Event-Based Diversity

```python
def select_photos_event_diversity(events, photos_per_event=2):
    """
    Select photos ensuring representation from each significant event.

    Args:
        events: List of Event objects (from ST-DBSCAN)
        photos_per_event: Photos to select per event

    Returns:
        Selected photos
    """
    selected = []

    # Sort events by significance
    events.sort(key=lambda e: e.significance_score, reverse=True)

    for event in events:
        # Sort photos in event by quality
        event.photos.sort(key=lambda p: p.aesthetic_score, reverse=True)
        selected.extend(event.photos[:photos_per_event])

    return selected
```

## Selection Algorithm Comparison

| Method | Best For | Tradeoff |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Temporal Binning | Even time coverage | May miss quality |
| Temporal MMR | Balanced quality + diversity | Slower computation |
| Event-Based | Event representation | Depends on event quality |
| Combined Pipeline | Production use | Most comprehensive |
