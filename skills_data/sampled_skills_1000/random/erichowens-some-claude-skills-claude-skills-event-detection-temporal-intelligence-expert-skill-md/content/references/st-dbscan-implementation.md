# ST-DBSCAN Implementation Reference

## Standard DBSCAN Review

**DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**

Core idea: Clusters are dense regions separated by sparse regions.

**Parameters:**
- ε (epsilon): Maximum distance for neighborhood
- MinPts: Minimum points to form dense region

```python
def dbscan(points, epsilon, min_pts):
    """

    Args:
        points: List of data points
        epsilon: Neighborhood radius
        min_pts: Minimum points for core point

    Returns:

## ST-DBSCAN (Spatio-Temporal DBSCAN)

**Innovation:** Separate thresholds for spatial (ε1) and temporal (ε2) dimensions.

**Key Insight:** 100 meters apart in same minute = same event. 100 meters apart 3 days later = different events.

**Modified Neighborhood Definition:**

```
Nε1,ε2(p) = {q | spatial_dist(p, q) ≤ ε1 AND temporal_dist(p, q) ≤ ε2}
```

**Parameters:**
- ε1: Maximum spatial distance (meters, e.g., 100m)
- ε2: Maximum temporal distance (seconds, e.g., 4 hours = 14400s)
- MinPts: Minimum points for core (e.g., 3 photos)

## DeepDBSCAN: Integrating Visual Content

**Problem:** ST-DBSCAN only uses time + GPS. What about photos taken at same place/time but of different subjects?

**Example:** Wedding at venue. Some photos are ceremony (important), some are empty chairs during setup (mundane).

**Solution:** Add visual similarity dimension using CLIP embeddings.

**Three-Dimensional Clustering:** Time × Space × Visual Content

## Parameter Tuning Guide

```
eps_spatial:  50m for indoor events, 500m for outdoor festivals, 5km for city tours
eps_temporal: 1 hour for short events, 8 hours for day trips, 24 hours for multi-day
eps_visual:   0.3 for similar subjects (all photos of ceremony), 0.5 for diverse event
min_pts:      3 for small gatherings, 10 for large events/trips
```

## Hierarchical Event Detection

**Problem:** Events have natural hierarchy. "Paris Vacation" contains "Day 1: Louvre Visit", "Day 2: Eiffel Tower", etc.

**Solution:** Multi-level ST-DBSCAN with cascading thresholds.

```python
def hierarchical_event_detection(photos):
    """
    Detect events at multiple temporal scales.

    Returns:
        Hierarchy of events (tree structure)
    """
    # Level 1: Multi-day events (vacations, trips)
    high_level_events = st_dbscan(
        photos,
        eps_spatial=50_000,  # 50km (whole city/region)
        eps_temporal=72 * 3600,  # 3 days
        min_pts=10
    )

    event_hierarchy = {}

    # Level 2: Daily events within each high-level event
    for event_id in set(high_level_events):
        if event_id == -1:  # Skip noise
            continue

        # Photos in this high-level event
        event_photos = [p for i, p in enumerate(photos)
                       if high_level_events[i] == event_id]

        # Cluster into daily sub-events
        sub_events = st_dbscan(
            event_photos,
            eps_spatial=5000,  # 5km (neighborhood)
            eps_temporal=12 * 3600,  # 12 hours
            min_pts=3
        )

        event_hierarchy[event_id] = {
            'photos': event_photos,
            'sub_events': sub_events
        }

    return event_hierarchy
```
