# Obsidian Workflows & Second Brain Methodology

Actionable guidance for building and maintaining a second brain in Obsidian. This skill focuses on workflows and decisions — not PARA theory (Claude already knows that).

## PARA Quick Reference

Organize by **actionability**, not topic:

| Category | What Goes Here | Review Cadence |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Projects** | Active work with clear endpoints | Weekly |
| **Areas** | Ongoing responsibilities, no endpoint | Monthly |
| **Resources** | Reference materials, future interest | Quarterly |
| **Archives** | Completed/inactive from above | Annually |

When in doubt: "Does this have a deadline or clear outcome?" Yes = Project. "Is this an ongoing responsibility?" Yes = Area. Otherwise = Resource.

## Key Workflows

### Capture (minimize friction)

1. Drop everything into Inbox
2. Minimal formatting — structure comes later
3. One idea per note (atomic)
4. Include source and why it matters
5. Tag as `#inbox` for processing

### Inbox Processing (weekly review, 30 min)

For each inbox note, decide:
- **Delete** — Not useful, was impulse capture
- **Archive** — Useful reference but no action needed now
- **Elaborate** — Add context, links, tags, then move to PARA category

Target: empty inbox weekly.

### Review Cadences

| Cadence | Time | What to Do |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Daily** | 5 min | Create daily note, review active projects, process quick captures |
| **Weekly** | 30 min | Process inbox completely, review all projects, update areas, clean loose ends |
| **Monthly** | 1 hour | Review areas, archive completed projects, check OKRs/goals, update MOCs |
| **Quarterly** | 2 hours | Strategic review, archive inactive resources, consolidate tags, adjust PARA |

## Linking Rules

### The 2-Link Rule

Every new note links to at least 2 existing notes. This prevents orphans and forces context-building. Ask "What does this connect to?" before saving.

### MOCs vs Dashboards

Keep these separate — they serve different purposes:

**MOCs (Maps of Content)** — Hand-curated navigation. Each link includes *why* it's connected. Create when a topic has 10+ related notes. Updated intentionally, not constantly.

**Dashboards** — Auto-generated views (dataview queries). Show recent activity, stats, tasks. No manual curation needed.

### When to Create a MOC

- Topic has 10+ related notes
- Need an overview of a knowledge area
- Connecting notes across multiple PARA categories
- Want curated navigation (not just a flat list)

## Evergreen Notes (3-Layer Pattern)

Concept notes that grow over time:

**Layer 1 — Definition:** What is this concept? Your own words, core explanation. Rarely changes.

**Layer 2 — Related:** How does this connect? 2-5 links with *reasons*:
```markdown
## Related
- [[Event Loop]] — closures power async callbacks
- [[Garbage Collection]] — closures affect GC behavior
```

**Layer 3 — Encounters:** Real-world usage added over time:
```markdown
# Encounters

## 2026-02-05 - Debugging closure scope issue
Discovered that closures in a forEach loop captured the loop variable by reference.
Link: [[TIL 2026-02-05]]
```

Use Outgoing Links panel to discover connections you missed.

## Progressive Summarization

Refine notes just-in-time (when you revisit them, not when you capture):

1. **Capture** — Full source material
2. **Bold** — Key passages (10-20% of content)
3. **Highlight** — Within bold (10-20% of that)
4. **Summarize** — 2-3 sentence executive summary at top
5. **Remix** — Create new output from distilled knowledge

Apply layers only when you return to a note for a specific purpose. Don't process everything upfront.

## Integration with Plugin Commands

This skill informs all plugin commands and agents:
- `/daily-startup` uses daily note workflow patterns
- `/process-inbox` implements inbox processing workflow
- `/review-okrs` applies review cadences to goal tracking
- `/maintain-vault` ensures link health and organization
