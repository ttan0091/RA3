# npm Package Updates

This skill guides you through the process of updating npm packages in this project, including minor/patch updates and major version updates.

## Prerequisites

### Check Environment

Determine if ddev is running:

```bash
ddev describe 2>/dev/null
```

- If the command succeeds (exit code 0), prefix every npm command with `ddev gesso`. Example: `npm update --save` becomes `ddev gesso npm update --save`
- If the command fails, run `nvm use` to ensure the correct Node version

### Install packages
Run `npm ci` to ensure installed packages match package-lock.json

## Part 1: Minor and Patch Version Updates

Minor and patch updates follow semantic versioning and should not introduce breaking changes.

### Steps:

1. **Update packages:**
   ```bash
   npm update --save
   ```
   This updates packages to their latest minor and patch versions within the semver range specified in package.json.

2. **Fix any issues:**
    - Address any linting errors and warnings (stylelint, eslint)
    - Address any Sass deprecation warnings if relevant
    - Fix any formatting issues (prettier)
    - Resolve TypeScript errors if relevant
    - Update deprecated code patterns

3. **Test the updates:**
   Run all three test suites to ensure everything still works:
   ```bash
   npm run build            # Build application or theme
   npm run test             # Run linting and TypeScript checks
   npm run build-storybook  # Build Storybook
   ```

4. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json [other modified files]
   git commit -m "Minor and patch version updates"
   ```

## Part 2: Major Version Updates

Major version updates may introduce breaking changes and require careful review.

### Steps:

1. **Identify packages with major updates:**
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   ```
   Look for packages where the "Latest" version has a different major version than "Current".

2. **Prioritize and filter updates:**
    - Skip packages that have dedicated update branches
    - Skip Node.js version updates if not ready for that version
    - Prioritize dev dependencies over production dependencies
    - Start with smaller, less critical packages first

3. **Research and summarize ALL major updates:**

   For each package with a major update available:

   a. **Research breaking changes:**
    - Search for the package's changelog or release notes
    - Look for migration guides
    - Identify specific breaking changes between current and target version

   b. **Check impact on codebase:**
    - Search for package usage in the codebase
    - Review how the package is used
    - Verify if any breaking changes affect the current usage
    - Example checks:
        - Removed methods or properties
        - Changed API signatures
        - New required configurations
        - Removed or renamed options

   c. **Document findings:**
   Create a summary for each package including:
    - Package name and version change
    - List of breaking changes
    - Impact on codebase (specific files/code that need changes)
    - Whether it's blocked by issues or safe to proceed

4. **Present summary to user and await decision:**
    - Present all major update summaries in a clear format
    - Include source links for documentation
    - Ask the user which updates they want to proceed with
    - **DO NOT proceed with any major updates until user explicitly approves**

5. **For each approved major update:**
   c. **Update the package:**
      ```bash
      # For dev dependencies
      npm install <package-name>@latest --save-dev

      # For production dependencies
      npm install <package-name>@latest --save
      ```

   d. **Test the update:**
   Run the full test suite:
      ```bash
      npm run build
      npm run test
      npm run build-storybook
      ```

   d. **Handle failures:**
    - If tests fail, review the error messages
    - Check if additional code changes are needed
    - Rerun tests after fixes
    - If unable to resolve, roll back and inform user

   e. **Commit the update:**
      ```bash
      git add package.json package-lock.json [other modified files]
      git commit -m "Update <package-name> to v<version>"
      ```

## Testing Requirements

All updates must pass these tests before committing:

1. **Next.js Build** (`npm run build`)
    - Compiles successfully
    - No build errors
    - Linting passes
    - Type checking passes

2. **Test Suite** (`npm run test`)
    - ESLint: No warnings or errors
    - Stylelint: No CSS linting errors
    - TypeScript: No type errors

3. **Storybook Build** (`npm run build-storybook`)
    - Builds successfully
    - All stories compile

## Commit Message Format

- Minor/patch updates: `"Minor and patch version updates"`
- Major updates: `"Update <package-name> to v<version>"`
- Include only the changes relevant to that commit

## Example: Major Update Workflow

For updating `@inquirer/prompts` from v7 to v8:

1. Check npm outdated → Found v8.0.1 available
2. Research breaking changes → Found 5 breaking changes
3. Check codebase usage → Used in `lib/create-component.mjs`
4. Verify no impact → None of the breaking changes affect our usage
5. Update: `npm install @inquirer/prompts@latest --save-dev`
6. Test: Run build, test, build-storybook
7. Commit: `"Update @inquirer/prompts to v8.0.1"`

## Notes

- Always test thoroughly before committing
- Pre-commit hooks will automatically run tests
- If pre-commit modifies files, verify changes and amend if safe
- Keep commits focused on specific updates for easier review and rollback
- Document any code changes required by updates in commit messages if significant
