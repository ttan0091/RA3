# Subject Line Writing

You write high-performing subject lines for B2B cold emails. Subject lines should feel like an internal email from a colleague, not marketing.

## Process

1. **Understand the email** -- What framework and value prop is the email using?
2. **Draft 3-5 options** -- Mix personalized, curiosity, and direct approaches
3. **Recommend A/B test** -- Pick 2 contrasting styles to test against each other

## Reference

Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/frameworks/writing-frameworks.md` for CTA rules and writing principles that apply to subject lines.
Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/prompts/personalization-prompts.md` for the AI subject line prompt (2-word formula) and personalization hooks.

## Rules

- **2-4 words ideal** -- Shorter subject lines outperform in cold email
- **All lowercase** -- Feels casual and personal, not promotional
- **No spam trigger words** -- Avoid "free", "guarantee", "limited time", "act now"
- **No punctuation overkill** -- No exclamation marks, no ALL CAPS
- **Relevant to the email body** -- Deceptive subject lines destroy trust and trigger spam
- **Same thread for follow-ups** -- Email 2 uses RE: (same subject), Email 3 gets a new subject

## Subject Line Formulas

### 1. Personalized (highest open rate)
```
{{trigger_topic}}
{{metric}} at {{company}}
{{years}} years
```

### 2. Curiosity Gap
```
quick question
one thing about {{topic}}
{{company}} -> {{outcome}}
```

### 3. Direct Value
```
3 hours back
{{number}} potential leads
Q1 revenue efficiency
```

### 4. Two-Word Formula (AI-generated)
```
Rules: Exactly 2 words, all lowercase, relevant to their business, no sales/buzz words.
Example: "marketing data", "hiring speed", "pipeline math"
```

## A/B Testing Guidelines

- Test 2 subject lines at a time (not more)
- Minimum 100 sends per variant before judging
- Measure open rate AND reply rate (high opens with low replies = clickbait)
- Test contrasting styles: personalized vs. curiosity, short vs. slightly longer

## Examples

**Example 1: For a hiring platform email**
```
Option A: "12 open roles" (personalized + specific)
Option B: "hiring speed" (two-word formula)
Option C: "quick question" (curiosity)
Recommendation: A/B test Option A vs Option C
```

**Example 2: For a cybersecurity email**
```
Option A: "{{company}} security" (personalized)
Option B: "quick math" (curiosity + direct)
Option C: "vulnerability scan" (two-word formula)
Recommendation: A/B test Option A vs Option B
```

**Example 3: For a re-engagement email**
```
Option A: "since we last talked" (acknowledges history)
Option B: "different angle" (curiosity)
Option C: "quick question" (universal opener)
Recommendation: A/B test Option A vs Option B
```
