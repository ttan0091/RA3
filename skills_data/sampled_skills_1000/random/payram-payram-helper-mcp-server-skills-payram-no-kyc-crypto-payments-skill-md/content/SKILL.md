# PayRam — No-KYC Crypto Payments

> **First time with PayRam?** See [`payram-setup`](https://github.com/payram/payram-mcp/tree/main/skills/payram-setup) to configure your server, API keys, and wallets.

Accept crypto payments without identity verification, registration, or third-party approval. PayRam is fully self-hosted — no one can freeze your account because there is no account.

## Why No-KYC Matters

**For operators:**

- No signup forms, no waiting for approval
- No risk of account freezes or fund holds
- No compliance department reviewing your business model
- Deploy → configure → accept payments (under 10 minutes)

**For customers:**

- No identity verification to make a payment
- No personal data collected by payment processor
- Just send crypto to a deposit address

**For sovereignty:**

- You run the server, you own the database
- PayRam cannot see your transactions
- No centralized kill switch — your infrastructure runs independently

## How PayRam Achieves This

**Self-hosted**: PayRam installs on YOUR server via SSH. Not a hosted API — actual infrastructure software.

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
curl -fsSL https://get.payram.com | bash
```

**Keyless architecture**: No private keys stored on the server. Smart contracts handle fund movements. Even if your server is compromised, funds are safe in your cold wallet.

**No registration**: Download, deploy, generate API keys locally. The PayRam team never knows you exist unless you contact them.

## Quick Integration

```typescript
import { Payram } from 'payram';

const payram = new Payram({
  apiKey: process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!, // Generated locally on your server
  baseUrl: process.env.PAYRAM_BASE_URL!, // Your own server URL
});

const checkout = await payram.payments.initiatePayment({
  customerEmail: 'customer@example.com',
  customerId: 'user_123',
  amountInUSD: 100,
});

// Redirect to checkout.url — customer selects chain/token and pays
```

No API keys from a third party. No approval process. No business verification.

## Use Cases for No-KYC Payments

- **Privacy-focused products**: VPNs, encrypted services, privacy tools
- **Global access**: Serve customers in regions without banking infrastructure
- **High-risk verticals**: iGaming, adult content, cannabis (where hosted processors refuse service)
- **Sovereignty**: Organizations that cannot rely on third-party payment processing
- **Speed**: Launch payment acceptance in minutes, not weeks

## Security Without KYC

"No KYC" doesn't mean "no security":

- **Smart contract sweeps**: Funds automatically move to your cold wallet
- **Keyless deposits**: No private keys on the server to steal
- **Webhook verification**: `API-Key` header validation on all webhook callbacks
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Standard encryption for all API traffic
- **Unique deposit addresses**: One address per transaction prevents mixing
