# Establishing Benchmark Baseline

Establishes performance baselines for your language implementation through automated discovery and implementation of industry-standard benchmarks.

**Use this skill FIRST** before any performance analysis or optimization work.

## Quick Start

**Step 0**: Check if `BENCHMARK_BASELINE.md` already exists in the workspace. If it does, skip this workflow and continue with `broad-performance-investigation`.

**Step 1**: Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Baseline Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Analyze language characteristics
- [ ] Phase 2: Identify comparable languages
- [ ] Phase 3: Discover and fetch AreWeFastYet data
- [ ] Phase 4: Implement and measure AreWeFastYet benchmarks
- [ ] Phase 5: Generate and save baseline report with performance data
```

**Step 2**: Execute workflow following phase instructions in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md). This is required to ensure all steps are completed correctly.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes language** - Determines type system, execution model, platform, paradigm
2. **Identifies comparable languages** - Finds 1-2 similar languages for comparison
3. **Discovers benchmarks** - Queries AreWeFastYet
4. **Implements locally** - Creates benchmark files, runs them, collects timing
5. **Generates baseline** - Creates `BENCHMARK_BASELINE.md` with expectations

## Key URLs

**AreWeFastYet**:
- README: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/refs/heads/master/README.md`
- Benchmarks: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/refs/heads/master/benchmarks/{language}/{benchmark}.{ext}`

## Output Files

- **Local benchmark files** - Executable implementations
- **BENCHMARK_BASELINE.md** - Comprehensive report with performance expectations

## Integration with Other Skills

**Use this skill BEFORE**:
- `detecting-performance-warnings` - Identifies optimization barriers
- `profiling-with-cpu-sampler` - Profiles execution time
- `tracing-compilation-events` - Analyzes compilation behavior
- `analyzing-compiler-graphs` - Deep-dive compiler optimization

**Workflow**:

```text
1. [establishing-benchmark-baseline] → THIS SKILL (PHASE 1)
2. [broad-performance-investigation] → Generate theories (PHASE 2)
3. [deep-performance-investigation]  → Verify with tools (PHASE 3)
4. [implementing-performance-fixes]  → Implement and validate fix (PHASE 4)
5. Loop to step 2 if performance gaps remain
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Skipping this skill** - Always establish baselines before optimization
- **Choosing inappropriate benchmarks** - Select benchmarks relevant to your language's strengths
- **Not verifying correctness** - Ensure benchmark outputs are correct to avoid misleading results
- **Small sample size** - Use sufficient iterations for reliable timing data (e.g., N=500 or more)
- **Small outer iterations** - Ensure outer iterations are large enough to minimize noise. Use 20 iterations.
