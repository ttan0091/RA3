## Best Practices

**DO:**
✅ Clone seeder-page.php
✅ Use SweetAlert2
✅ Bootstrap Icons only
✅ Escape HTML
✅ Fetch API
✅ CSRF tokens
✅ Cache-bust shared JS updates with `?v=YYYYMMDD`
✅ Trace data shape end-to-end when debugging `not a function`

**DON'T:**
❌ Native alert/confirm
❌ Mix icon sets
❌ Create from scratch
❌ Inline handlers
❌ Skip auth checks

✅ Auto-trigger `window.print()` in `*-print.php` views so the dialog appears as soon as the DOM is ready, keeping `no-print` controls only for reprints.

## Frontend Design Standards

This skill guides the construction of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic “AI slop” aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to detail and creative choices. When the user provides frontend requirements—be it a component, page, application, or interface—treat the ask as a chance to craft something unforgettable rather than a safe, templated layout. Refer to the complete terms in LICENSE.txt when invoking this aesthetic directive.

When the request is for dashboards, admin panels, SaaS apps, tools, settings pages, or data interfaces, follow the Interface Design workflow in [skills/webapp-gui-design/sections/09-interface-design.md](skills/webapp-gui-design/sections/09-interface-design.md) before proposing a direction or writing UI code.

## Executive UI Mode (C-Suite)

When the UI is for executives or owners, enforce these rules:

- Dashboard-first: show 4-6 KPIs at the top, then approvals, then reports.
- At-a-glance: large numbers, short labels, one-line trend context.
- Minimalism: remove secondary controls by default; hide advanced filters behind a toggle.
- Actionability: pair insights with clear next actions (Approve, Decline, Contact).
- Speed: prioritize first paint and cached summaries over deep tables.
- Device-agnostic: identical workflows across desktop and mobile.
- Readability: high contrast, large base font, plain language labels.
- Dark mode: offer optional dark mode for extended viewing.
- Brand control: use the product primary color for key highlights only.

**Dynapharm brand note:** primary color is deep red. Use it sparingly for primary actions and critical highlights, never for large background fills.

### Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose:** What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone:** Pick an extreme (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.). Use those flavors for inspiration and design something true to the chosen aesthetic.
- **Constraints:** Technical requirements such as framework, performance, or accessibility.
- **Differentiation:** What makes this unforgettable? What is the single thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL:** Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Both bold maximalism and refined minimalism work—the key is intentionality, not intensity. Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is production-grade, visually striking, cohesive, and meticulously refined.

### Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography:** Choose beautiful, unique, and expressive fonts. Avoid generic families (Arial, Inter, Roboto, system stacks); opt for distinctive pairings where a characterful display font meets a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme:** Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents create more impact than timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion:** Deliver animations for high-impact moments (staggered reveals, hero transitions, hover surprises). Favor CSS-only solutions for static HTML and use Motion libraries for React when appropriate. Staggered delays and scroll-triggered reveals beat scattershot micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition:** Exploit asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, generous negative space, or controlled density. Break the grid when it reinforces the concept.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details:** Build atmosphere with gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, or grain overlays.

NEVER ship generic AI-generated aesthetics: avoid overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system), cliché palettes (especially purple-on-white gradients), predictable layouts, and cookie-cutter component patterns. Every design should feel tailored to its context.

Interpret creatively, pick unexpected choices, and rotate through light/dark themes, different fonts, and varied aesthetics. DON’T repeat the same set of design decisions across outputs (e.g., no repeated Space Grotesk + monochrome combos).

**IMPORTANT:** Match the implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist concepts demand elaborate code (animations, layered effects); minimalist ideas require restraint, pixel-perfect spacing, and subtle refinements. Claude can deliver extraordinary creative work—commit fully to a distinctive vision.

## Common Mistakes

❌ `alert('Success!');` → ✅ `Swal.fire('Success!', '', 'success');`
❌ `<div>${data.name}</div>` → ✅ `<div>${escapeHtml(data.name)}</div>`
❌ `<i class="fa fa-plus">` → ✅ `<i class="bi bi-plus">`
❌ Assuming arrays from APIs → ✅ `Array.isArray(x) ? x : x.key || []`
